🩺 Oral Cancer Detection using Machine Learning (CNN & Image Processing)
This project focuses on building an AI-powered system for early detection of Oral Cancer using Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques. The model classifies oral cavity images into Benign (Non-Cancerous) or Malignant (Cancerous) categories and provides a confidence score. The system also integrates image preprocessing, lesion segmentation, and a user-friendly interface for real-time prediction.
